##   Description   ##

#   For this test, you have to implement a serial reaction time task. In this task, participants 
#   see 6 squares next to each other and each trial a target appears in one of the 6 locations. Participants 
#   have to press one of 6 corresponding buttons as fast as possible. What participants donâ€™t know however 
#   is that there is a fixed sequence in which the targets appear (e.g., 2-1-5-4-3-6). If participants 
#   implicitly learn this sequence, we expect their reaction times to decrease over time. As we want to 
#   distinguish learning from practice effects, we also include a block with a random sequence, which allows 
#   us to explore a difference in reaction time decreases between a structured and a random block.
