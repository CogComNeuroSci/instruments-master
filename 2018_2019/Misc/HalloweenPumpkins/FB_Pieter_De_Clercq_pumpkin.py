# Esther: tot hier perfect, maar misschien hier en daar een witlijntje en een lijntje comments om je code op te vrolijken en uit te leggen?

# Esther: ik zie dat je een bepaalde tint organje hebt gezocht en die blijft gebruiken.
# Esther: een handige shortcut hier is om op voorhand dat oranje te definiÃ«ren:
# OrangjePieter = (0.851,-0.075,-1.000)
# Esther: daarna kan je dan naar die OranjePieter verwijzen, zoals hier:
# Ltand = visual.ShapeStim(win, vertices = LtandVert, fillColor = OrangjePieter,lineColor=OrangjePieter)
# Rtand = visual.ShapeStim(win, vertices = RtandVert, fillColor = OrangjePieter,lineColor=OrangjePieter)
# Otand = visual.ShapeStim(win, vertices =OtandVert, fillColor = OrangjePieter,lineColor=OrangjePieter)
# Esther: als je achteraf dan toch een andere tint oranje wil kiezen, hoef je dat maar op 1 plaats aan te passen ;)
